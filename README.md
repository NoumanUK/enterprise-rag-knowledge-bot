Enterprise RAG-Based Knowledge Bot
Overview

Organizations store critical internal knowledge across documents such as policies, SOPs, onboarding guides, and internal manuals. As document volume grows, employees struggle to find accurate information quickly using traditional keyword-based search.

This project implements an enterprise-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge bot that enables employees to ask natural-language questions and receive grounded, source-backed answers from internal company documents.

The system is designed to be production-oriented, hallucination-aware, and cloud-deployable, with a strong focus on engineering tradeoffs rather than demo-level AI usage.
